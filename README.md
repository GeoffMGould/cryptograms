How to make simple substitution codes as seen in Penny Dell Puzzle books

I love puzzles and I have for all of my adult life and beyond. My parents taught me how to do crossword puzzles and we used to work on them together as a family on long car trips on the way to visit relatives. I got good at crossword puzzles, so much so that I was studied by sociology students when I was in college at Northwestern. 

After college I branched out to a variety of logic, number, and word puzzles. I worked as a seasonal wildlife biology technician which consisted of a lot of travel and living by myself in remote locations, often without Internet or any electricity at all. Somewhere along the way I became familiar with variety puzzle books produced by Penny Dell and I spent hundreds of hours working through the puzzles in these books as I passed my down time in the evenings.

My favorite among these are what they call "Cryptograms." A series of witticisms, aphorisms, and inspirational quotes are scrambled using a simple substitution code in which each letter in the scrambled version stands for a different letter in the original. Usually 12-20 of these scrambled quotations are presented together and the code is different for each one. 

Like my hockey scheduling programs, the genesis for this program was me wondering how they produce these puzzles. Of course I had to dismiss the idea that someone sits there and does it manually, keeping track of all the letters in a notebook, checking it over again and again to make sure they didn't make any mistakes. The obvious answer is that it's done by computer. But how? This is what I set out to figure out, and perhaps ironically, in doing so I created a new type of puzzle for me to solve - this program represents my first foray into solving real world problems with computer programs. It's my personal goal to now become a professional puzzle solver in the emerging field of programming and data science and to turn my love of puzzles into a satisfying career. 

My solution is presented here along with a sample input and output. It includes an Easter egg for those familiar with the origin of the name "Python" and the entity referenced by the name. While relatively short, the program demonstrates application of functions, dictionaries, string methods, loops, and interactive programming along with I/O.
